# hi there

#### Here is where we store the code 

### scraping 
If we need to scrape data from the internet for usable example data, we'll do that with python/BeautifulSoup.

### server 
With basic knowledge from Systems, we will have a simple C++ client for putting the app up on the internet as long as the user/tester has access to the port number they need.

### bootstrap 
We intend to use bootstrap to design/code the app visually -- it's a popular standard that front-end developers definitely need to know to some extent.
